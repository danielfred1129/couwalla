            <b>Security</b>
            <p>
                The security of your personal information is <br/>
                important to us. When you provide <br/>
                sensitive information (such as a credit card <br/>
                number) to us, we encrypt the <br/>
                transmission of that information using<br/>
                secure socket layer technology (SSL).<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                We follow generally accepted industry<br/>
                standards to protect the personal<br/>
                information submitted to us, both during<br/>
                transmission and once we receive it. No<br/>
                method of transmission, or method of<br/>
                electronic storage, is 100% secure.<br/>
                Therefore, we cannot guarantee its<br/>
                absolute security.
            </p>
